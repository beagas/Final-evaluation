we made tests for valid and invalid user login,
Since login is one of the dore functionality, it is very inmportant to confirm,
that system reacts correctly to valid credentials by providing access. And provides correct error 
message to incorrect credentials. Doesnt allow to access site for unauthorized ones

By verifying that an order appears in the order history after being placed, 
the tests ensure that the system provides feedback to users about their actions. 
This builds trust, as users can see that their actions are recorded and acknowledged, 
which is essential for e-commerce and transaction-based systems.

If an order isn't recorded in history, it might indicate problems with the database, 
transaction handling, or communication between components, all of which are critical 
areas to monitor.

The automated tests we made are easy to scale up to made bigger scale tests for more accurate functionality testing
